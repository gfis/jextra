Package jextra
</title>
</head>
<body>
JExtra is an incrementally extensible translator generator written in Java. 
The package contains:
<ul>
<li>an LR(1) parser generator comparable to <em>yacc</em> or <em>bison</em>, with
    an emphasis on XML for
    <ul>
        <li>grammar input</li>
        <li>parser table output</li> 
        <li>abstract syntax tree output</li>
    </ul>
<li>several parsing algorithms using the generated
push-down automaton state table, or simple finite state automata,
<li>several handwritten scanners for the low-level symbol recognition of commonly used
programming languages like C, Java, FORTRAN etc (other compiler projects use
finite state tables generated by tools like (f)lex for this purpose),
</ul>
<p>
The package is based in part on the algorithms in [1], and the corresponding EXTRA system
written in PL1/1 and later in FORTRAN in 1980.
